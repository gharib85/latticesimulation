Subroutines for tensor networks representation of long-range interactions.

Written by Zhendong Li (2018)

Some explanation of the codes:

 * ls1d    -	1D simulation tools

 * ls2d    -	2D operators by fitting 1/r on lattice
   * opt_simple	 - optimization tools
   * lr_test	 - long-range Heisenberg model
   * lr_test_mpi - long-range Heisenberg model (MPI)

 * ls3d    - 	fermionic correlation functions as TNS
              SOME TESTING SUBROUTINES CAN BE FOUND HERE.
