  Lattice simulation with TNS
         Z.Li@2017.11.16
 ==============================
 
 TODOs:
 
  -DONE- 1. kinetic term + framework for imaginary time evolution
 
  -DONE- 2. add Vne defined from inversion of e*(K+m^2a^2)^{-1}
 
  -DONE- 3. add Vee properly by substracting local terms !!! 
     	    (WHICH NOW TURNS OUR TO BE EXTREMELY SIMPLE)
 
  -????- 4. IMPORTANT: Accuracy issue !!!
   
  -????- 5. 1D atom [MPS/MPO] - basically all prepared.
 
  -????- 6. 2D case [fPEPS] 
	    - Construction of initial guess
	    - Efficient compression scheme (canonicalization)
 
  -????- 7. estimate energy by direct computation <Psi|H|Psi>
            or by fitting correlation functions <Psi|ni*nj|Psi> by exps.
 
  -????- 8. target system: H2 and He in 1D and 2D.
